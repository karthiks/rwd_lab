	<!-- Eric Meyer is well known for the creation of a "reset stylesheet".
	     This resets the styling of all CSS back to its default -->
	<!-- Alternatively you could use Normalize.CSS for this purpose -->
	<link href="reset.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
	<!-- This is where our custom styling is put -->
	<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

	<!-- Mobile devices by default renders the page as 980px even as its width is about 320px. Nuts! -->
	<!-- This line below detects the width of the physical device and sets it as the width detected by the CSS,
	     thus setting right the weird rendering in mobile phones. Thanks Apple!-->

	<!-- Older versions of IE (ones less than 9) do not allow unknown elements to be styled without JavaScript.

			<p>If you're dreading the inevitable day your New Year's resolutions - to lose weight, get a better job, and drink less, perhaps? - fall flat, it might be because you need different resolutions. Instead of focusing on outcomes, why not set your sights on process in 2014? Here, 10 resolutions you can't fail at, inspired by TED Talks published this year.

			"There are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now," says Korean author Young-ha Kim-that is, all the reasons we invent when we're too scared or intimidated. But, Kim reminds us, "We are all born artists." Unleash those suppressed artistic impulses: take an acting class, buy some paint, or just sit with a notebook and write like crazy.
			We sit even more than we sleep, and it's terrible for our health. So for 2014, make a commitment to getting up: schedule walking meetings and get-togethers, use a treadmill desk, or work standing up. At least part of the time.
			Benedictine monk David Steindl-Rast explains that gratefulness is our path to happiness, and that all it takes is a shift in perspective: stop what you're doing, open yourself up to the opportunities around you, and act on them. Do this as much as you can, even if it means writing yourself reminders and posting them all over your apartment.
			"Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals," psychologist Angela Lee Duckworth says. "Grit is living life like a marathon, not a sprint." Grit is also essential for success. If you expect to meet your goals immediately and give up when you don't, you'll probably be giving up a lot. But if you expect setbacks and can give your goals some breathing room, you have a much better shot.
